My purpose here is to learn something about making an application using SDL and Dear ImGui, as I am used to using Qt and wanted to learn a different way. Where does it go next? Now that I have it running enought to where it is fun for me, I'll separate the model from the view which will enable me to 1. have a proper viewport 2. make it easier to implement the model on GPU, and 3. allow me to toggle some different visualizations that will add some color (e.g. color based on how long ago a pixel was last 'alive'). I also could add some presets that will make it easier to see some of the cool behaviors that come arise from the standard Conway's Game rules, and how changing those rules can result in some new and cool behaviors.
If I am still having fun I might play around with different SDL backends and/or implement and optimize the rules with CUDA to make it run as fast as I can for some reason (though it runs plenty fine as it is..).
