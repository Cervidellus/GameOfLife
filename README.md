My purpose here is to learn something about making an application using SDL and Dear ImGui, as I am used to using Qt and wanted to learn a different way. I've implemented an interface to play with the parameters of the model, as well as to choose cool colormaps to make it look nice. You can choose some presets of these parameters as well as a couple of samples of some more complex oscillators. Where does it go next? I'd like to be able to load presets from files downloaded from https://conwaylife.com/wiki/, and to allow you to copy and paste RLE encoded patterns from the same site.
If I am still having fun I might play around with different SDL backends and/or implement and optimize the rules with CUDA to make it run as fast as I can for some reason (though it runs plenty fine as it is..).
